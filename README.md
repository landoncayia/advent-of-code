# Advent of Code solutions

Hi! This is my repository of Advent of Code solutions. I have not been consistent about completing these, and hope to improve in the future. Making a public repository will hopefully help me stay more consistent! My 2020 solutions were completed in pure Python (.py) files, but from now on I am working in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files.
